# To-Do-Lists
This is a basic web-based To-Do List application that helps users manage their daily tasks easily. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to:

✅ Add new tasks using an input field and button.

🗑️ Remove tasks when they're no longer needed.

☑️ Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a strikethrough style.
